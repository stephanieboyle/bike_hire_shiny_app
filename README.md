You can access the full app here: [stephanie-boyle.shinyapps.io/](https://stephanie-boyle.shinyapps.io/edinburgh_bike_hire_data_app/)

This app allows exploration and visualisation of data from the Just Eat Cycles hire bikes in Edinburgh. Their locations are on the map below. It uses information from the Just Eat Cycles open web data. You can find the data, license, and data dictionary here. The code for this project can be found on Github. Currently the app does not connect directly to the Just Eat Cycles site and is manually refreshed. The data was last updated Feb-2021.

## What's in the App?
